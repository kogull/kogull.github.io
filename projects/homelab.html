                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    After recently building a new PC, I found myself with an extra one lying around. I took this opportunity to start a home lab. 
                    Proxmox was my chosen hypervisor, and setting up my lab was a month-long process that involved configuring everything properly. 
                    This included backing up and preparing old drives, acquiring new drives, configuring my default router, and finding an appropriate location.
                </p>

                <h3>Skills</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>PC Building:</strong> Experience in assembling and configuring PCs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hypervisors:</strong> Proficient in using Proxmox for virtualization.</li>
                    <li><strong>Network Attached Storage (NAS):</strong> Skilled in setting up and configuring TrueNAS.</li>
                    <li><strong>Media Servers:</strong> Experience with Jellyfin for hosting media content.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hardware Acceleration:</strong> Knowledge of using graphics cards and Quicksync for hardware acceleration.</li>
                    <li><strong>Docker:</strong> Familiar with setting up and configuring Docker for various projects.</li>
                    <li><strong>Networking:</strong> Configuring routers and managing network settings.</li>
                    <li><strong>Troubleshooting:</strong> Strong problem-solving skills and the ability to troubleshoot hardware and software issues.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Procedure</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>1. Preparing the Hardware</strong><br>
                    - Install the new hard drive by opening the computer case, mounting the drive, connecting the SATA and power cables, and closing the case.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    <strong>Proxmox Installation</strong><br>
                    After successfully installing Proxmox, the first task was to configure the storage through a network-attached solution. I chose TrueNAS for this purpose. The setup was almost straightforward. I created a container, installed the TrueNAS image, and logged in through the web UI. Currently, I only have one main HDD, so there is no form of redundancy.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    <strong>File/Media Server Setup</strong><br>
                    Next, I set up a file/media server that connected to my NAS for storage. The initial setup was confusing, but after some experimentation, it became clear. I chose Jellyfin to host this. Overall, the setup was straightforward. Additionally, my PC had a graphics card that I intended to use for hardware acceleration. However, after some experimentation, I found that my motherboard was not compatible due to no support for VT-d with my CPU. I have since chosen to use Quicksync functionality, which should suffice.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    <strong>Docker Setup</strong><br>
                    Lastly, I set up Docker for other smaller projects, such as game servers or software testing senarios. The setup was not quite straightforward, and Iâ€™m still working towards finding the right configuration.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Future Plans</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>VPN:</strong> To access my server remotely.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pi-hole:</strong> To manage ads through a DNS server.</li>
                    <li><strong>Game Servers:</strong> For hosting various games.</li>
                </ul>
